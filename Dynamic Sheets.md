## âœ… Suggested Solution: Handling Dynamic Sheet Names in Power Query

If your Excel workbook contains **only one worksheet**, you can use the following approaches to make your Power Query more flexible and avoid errors when the sheet name changes each week.

### ðŸ”§ Option 1: Remove the Navigation Step

* In **Power Query**, after loading the Excel file, you typically see a **"Navigation" step** that references a specific sheet by name (e.g., `"Sheet1"`).
* If thereâ€™s **only one sheet**, simply **delete this step**, and then:

  * Expand the `Data` column manually.
  * This allows Power Query to automatically pick up the available sheet.

### ðŸ”§ Option 2: Make the Navigation Step Dynamic

Instead of hardcoding the sheet name like this:

```m
= Source{[Item="Sheet1",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data]
```

Replace it with a more generic version that refers to the **first sheet by position**:

```m
= Source{0}[Data]
```
